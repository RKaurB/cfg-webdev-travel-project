# CFG UK Travel Website Project
UK travel website created as part of the Code First Girls 8-week Introduction to Web Development Programming course.

This project was presented alongside [CamilleBarbit](https://github.com/camillebarbit) and [Daria Nastasiy](), as part of our final group project for the [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) 8-week Introduction to Web Development.

**_Note:_** We covered JavaScript very briefly towards the end of the course, so for now we chose to create our project website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  We also ran out of time to create the About page.  Would be good to revisit and improve the website at some point.
